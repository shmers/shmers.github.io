title: "About me"
---

Outside of work, I enjoy chess, music, and endurance sports. I find these interests complement analytical work by encouraging long‑term thinking, focus, and resilience.

I'm an avid 3d printing enthusiast, speculative fiction reader, and amateur android app developer (for brain training apps and other simple games for which I design my own AI agents).
