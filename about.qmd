title: "About me"
---

Outside of work, I enjoy chess, music, and endurance sports. I find these interests complement analytical work by encouraging long‑term thinking, focus, and resilience.

I'm a 3d printing enthusiast, speculative fiction reader, and devoted cat dad. 

During my 2025 career break I've also become an amateur android app developer (so far for brain training apps and logic / puzzle games).
