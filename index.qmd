## Senior Data Scientist

I am a senior data scientist with over 10 years of experience designing, validating, and deploying predictive models in production environments. My background spans insurance, reinsurance, and financial services, with a focus on risk modelling, probability estimation, and data‑driven decision‑making under uncertainty.

This site presents a selection of **IP‑safe, self‑contained demonstration projects** that illustrate my approach to modelling, evaluation, and communication.

## Areas of Focus

- Predictive risk and pricing models  
- Rare‑event modelling and probability calibration  
- Model validation, monitoring, and governance  
- Applied machine learning in regulated environments
