title: "Designing a Predictive Risk Model for High-Value Assets"
---

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end approach to designing, validating, and evaluating a predictive risk model in a pricing context. The focus is on modelling judgement, feature design, and validation rather than maximising headline performance metrics.

All data used in this project is fully synthetic and does not reflect any proprietary datasets.

## Problem Statement

We consider a hypothetical insurance‑style problem where the goal is to predict the probability of a high‑cost loss event for individual policies, based on customer, asset, and contextual features.

Key challenges include:
- Class imbalance
- Feature leakage
- Model interpretability vs performance trade‑offs

---

## Data Generation

We generate a synthetic dataset designed to capture common characteristics of real‑world consumer risk portfolios:
- Skewed loss distribution
- Correlated features
- Rare but severe outcomes

## Data Generation

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

np.random.seed(42)

n = 20000

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "vehicle_value": np.random.lognormal(mean=10, sigma=0.5, size=n),
    "driver_age": np.random.randint(18, 80, size=n),
    "annual_mileage": np.random.gamma(shape=2, scale=6000, size=n),
    "urban_density": np.random.beta(2, 5, size=n),
    "prior_claims": np.random.poisson(0.3, size=n)
})

logit = (
    -7.0
    + 0.000002 * data["vehicle_value"]
    - 0.015 * data["driver_age"]
    + 0.00004 * data["annual_mileage"]
    + 1.5 * data["urban_density"]
    + 0.6 * data["prior_claims"]
)

prob = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-logit))
data["high_cost_claim"] = np.random.binomial(1, prob)

data.head()
